Loves Anatomy  

I love you with everything;
Completely, totally, consciously
Who I am loving who it is you are

Heart

I love you with all my heart it beats for you
Symbol crash, snare trap snap the snare drum, bass, tom tom, high hats
Mad love, chimney sweep children sent to clean out cheese valves
Trudging through blood memories that junk food and thick cheese has filled
Love sick, doctor electric, just cut the vain vein train telephone wires with
Hammer and sickle, love for poor, love for god, love for everyone, is love cynical?
My mighty meat muscle
That complex network, the fat fly squirming in spider web
Time bomb, the body of the internet

Brain

When I’m thinking to hard or maybe when I don’t think too much
My brain loves you, like now
Something feels like it’s the smartest thing I’ve ever never not had all the confidence to admit
In;
Grey matter motel, a cerebral troll waiting,
Soft tissue padded cell the poet does hard time
For protesting their thoughts on the internet of the body
Here I feel it all,
Frontal lobe
Ladies show intelligence for the gentleman who removes his top hat with the foreskin skull cap
Take the opportunity to see what you’re in for
To be in one another heads
Break bread, a brain trans-plant for the shared mind garden

Liver
It is, loving you with a drunk wisdom
Love drug, harmonies of hormones

Lungs
Leave me breathless, start to inflate my ego, compress my ego, rolling pin them
The gas, toxin, I love you through ventilation
